/**
 * A specialized Quad that represents a single rendered glyph (character) in text rendering.
 *
 * GlyphQuad extends Quad to add text-specific metadata and tracking information.
 * Each instance represents one visible character in a Text display, containing
 * both the visual representation (texture from the font atlas) and metadata
 * about the character's position within the text.
 *
 * This class is primarily used internally by the Text class for efficient
 * glyph management, pooling, and event handling. Each glyph can be individually
 * positioned, styled, and tracked.
 *
 * ```haxe
 * // Typically created internally by Text, but can be accessed:
 * text.onGlyphQuadsChange(this, (glyphQuads) -> {
 *     for (quad in glyphQuads) {
 *         trace('Character ${quad.char} at position ${quad.index}');
 *         trace('Line ${quad.line}, position in line: ${quad.posInLine}');
 *     }
 * });
 * ```
