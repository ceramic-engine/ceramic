 * Complete data structure containing all information about a bitmap font.

 * character definitions, texture page references, kerning pairs, and metrics.
 * This data is typically loaded from font definition files (like BMFont format)
 * and used to construct a BitmapFont instance.
 * 
 * The data includes:
 * - Font metadata (face name, sizes)
 * - Character definitions with texture coordinates and metrics
 * - Texture page information for multi-page fonts
 * - Kerning data for improved character spacing
 * - Optional distance field data for high-quality scaling
 * 
 * ```haxe
 * var fontData:BitmapFontData = {

 *     pointSize: 32,
 *     baseSize: 32,
